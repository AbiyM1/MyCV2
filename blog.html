            <h3>Relative Sizing in CSS</h3>
            <p>
                If You are familiar with CSS, you already know what relative and absolute sizing of objects.
                Setting font size of an element is quite easy.
                This concept becomes fairly vague in the domain of responsiveness. There are different arguments for
                setting the size of an element. <i>Px, em </i> and <i> rem </i>to be exact. <i> rem </i> is used to give tuning
                control over the
                sizing of an element to end-users.
                By default, <i> 1rem  </i>represents 16 pixels. This changes based on what the user set their font-size to in
                their browsers. This is a property shared with <i>em</i>
                sizing. But the difference is that <i>rem</i> always multiplies the size given against the html element. However the <i>em</i>
                multiplies against the parent element. Here is a link for further study <a href=" https://css-tricks.com/rem-global-em-local/" target="_blank">Click here</a>
