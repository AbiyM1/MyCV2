            <h3>CSS Units for font size</h3>
            <p>

                Setting font size of an element is quite easy.
                This concept becomes fairly vague in the domain of responsiveness and usability. There are different
                units for
                setting the size of an element. <i>Px, em </i> and <i> rem </i>to be exact. <i> rem </i> is used to give
                tuning
                control over the
                sizing of an element to end-users.
                By default, <i> 1rem </i>represents 16 pixels. This changes based on what the user set their font-size
                to in
                their browsers. This is a property shared with <i>em</i>
                sizing. But the difference is that <i>rem</i> always multiplies the size given against the html element.
                However the <i>em</i>
                multiplies against the parent element. Here is a link for further study: <a

            <p>
                The default width of a body is 16px or 1<i>em</i>. The browser interprets this to be the default size
                unless the user manually sets the size for an element in the body. This means if the manually given size
                is greater than what's given to the body by default, the body will extend itself to encompass the element.

            <p>
                CSS3 is a revamped version of css. In this version, many features were added and improved.
                For instance, box-sizing feature that is very significant for assigning a restricted space to a
                partition was added. Some other features of CSS3 include animation and transision property, advanced
                selectors,
                gradients, webfonts, 3d transforms, text shadow.
